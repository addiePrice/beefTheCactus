9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


Last year, I took several blocks of coding class. I've covered topics such as data abstraction, game programming, and other various coding concepts (dictionaries, lists, integers, floats, booleans, strings, etc). I've worked mostly in python, though I have explored a few other coding softwares like A-Frame and Html.



10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


This year, I made 3 videos explaining data abstraction and how the internet works. I also used VR fitness and mindfulness programs to learn about the effect of technology on wellness.


What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


I want to come up with more original programs rather than basing my programs off of examples and previous assignments. I also want to collaborate with friends this year because I haven't worked with other students in-person since last year. 


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


Writing programs from scratch is challenging for me. Most of my previous assignments came with an example program, so making a completely unique code without any instruction is new and challenging.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


I honestly don't see myself doing much programming after highschool. Regardless, I want to get to a place where I can come up with an idea in my head for a game or website and know how to code it. I also want to be proficient in several coding languages.
